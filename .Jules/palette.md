**Learning:** For backend Python libraries, "UX" translates to Developer Experience (DX). The "interface" is the API and how objects present themselves in debuggers and logs. A good `__repr__` is a micro-UX improvement that makes the library more intuitive.
**Action:** When working on non-GUI libraries, look for opportunities to improve `__repr__`, error messages, and progress feedback to enhance the developer's journey.
