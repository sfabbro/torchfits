**Learning:** For scientific data structures (like HDU lists), mimicking established standards (like Astropy's `info()` output) in `__repr__` provides immediate familiarity and utility to users, significantly improving the interactive exploration experience.
**Action:** When designing `__repr__` for complex containers in scientific tools, prioritize tabular summaries that match community standards over simple object descriptions.
