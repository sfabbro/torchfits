# Changelog

All notable changes to torchfits are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.5.0b3] - 2026-06-30

### Changed

- Refocused torchfits as a FITS I/O package: images, HDUs, headers, checksums,
  compression, FITS tables, caching, and table interop.
- Removed stale public claims that torchfits owns WCS, sphere geometry, HEALPix,
  sky-domain simulation, or training pipelines. Those domains belong outside
  torchfits.
- Added a roadmap and compatibility matrix that distinguish supported, partial,
  unsupported, and out-of-scope behavior.
- Replaced broad parity claims with test-backed parity tiers for common fitsio,
  Astropy, and selected CFITSIO-backed workflows.

### Added

- Extended benchmark matrix: native **uint16/uint32** 2D image fixtures, **typed**
  binary tables (BIT/complex/string columns), and **ASCII** table fixtures.
- `bench_all.py --mmap-matrix` runs mmap-on and mmap-off passes in one CSV so the
  I/O transport table can populate both `disk→CPU` and `disk→RAM→CPU` (plus GPU
  `disk→CPU→GPU` / `disk→RAM→GPU` when CUDA/MPS is available).
- `scripts/run_exhaustive_bench_and_patch_docs.sh` for lab-profile `bench-all` on
  CUDA/MPS hardware with automatic `docs/benchmarks.md` refresh.
- Lab CUDA benchmark snapshot `exhaustive_mmap_0.5.0b3_20260630_063118` (3474 rows,
  mmap on+off matrix, 720 GPU transport rows on H100).
- `docs/parity.md` for the public compatibility matrix.
- Astropy upstream smoke coverage for common image, HDU, compressed-image,
  table, ASCII table, VLA, complex column, and scaled-image workflows.
- Documentation integrity checks for stale WCS/sphere/HEALPix ownership claims.
- Supported-status promotion for in-place mmap table updates on COMPLEX
  (`1C`/`1M`), BIT (`8X`), and fixed-width STRING (`12A`-style) columns.
  `torchfits.table.update_rows(..., mmap=True)` now writes these column
  types correctly on disk. Verified via raw byte inspection and an astropy
  upstream-reader roundtrip. VLA columns remain explicitly unsupported in the mmap
  fast path by design.
- Astropy and fitsio upstream smoke coverage that exercises the
  COMPLEX / BIT / fixed-width STRING mmap-update parity shift,
  including right-padding to the declared column width and verification
  vs the upstream readers. The 8A-string assertion falls back to
  astropy because the local fitsio upstream misdecodes updated `8A`
  rows (the on-disk bytes are bit-exact to the expected layout; this
  is an upstream-reader limitation, not a torchfits writer bug).
- `tests/test_astropy_upstream_smoke.py::test_astropy_compimage_compression_variants_match_torchfits`
  exercising additional `astropy.io.fits.CompImageHDU` compression
  variants (RICE / HCOMPRESS / PLIO) round-tripped against torchfits.

### Fixed

- API docs and install guide now reference `torchfits.cache` for cache tuning
  (`configure_for_environment`, `get_cache_stats`, `clear_cache`) and the root
  I/O helpers `get_cache_performance` / `clear_file_cache` where appropriate.
- Roadmap mmap limitations updated to match the parity matrix (BIT and
  fixed-width STRING mmap updates are supported; VLA and scaled columns remain
  partial).

### Removed

- Dataset/training helper namespace from the torchfits package contract.

## [0.5.0b2] - 2026-06-30

### Fixed

- Patched `fitstable` specialised column projection and row slicing benchmark errors due to invalid `policy` argument.
- Cleaned up C++ build flags in `bench-gpu` to remove strict CUDA and Torch pins.
- Audited C++ codebase for potential memory leaks, redundant hardware heuristics, and API bounds.

### Added

- Restored core FITS benchmarks from v0.3.2: ML DataLoader performance (`bench_ml_loader.py`) and GPU Memory usage/leak validator (`bench_gpu_memory.py`).
- Added exhaustive progress print logging during benchmark execution.
- Added persistent cutout / multi-cutout repeated read benchmarks (`SubsetReader` / `open_subset_reader`) for both CPU and GPU.
- Added `read_tensor` for reading N-dimensional arrays (1D spectra, 2D images, 3D cubes, xD arrays) directly to a single PyTorch `Tensor`.
- Added `write_tensor` as the specialized PyTorch-native writer for writing single PyTorch `Tensor`s directly to FITS files.

### Deprecated

- Deprecated `read_image` in favor of the more general and PyTorch-native `read_tensor`.

## [0.5.0b1] - 2026-06-29

### Changed

- Repository home: `github.com/astroai/torchfits`.
- Default development Python is **3.13** (pixi); supported install range remains **3.10+**.
- Development Status classifier promoted to **Beta**.
- Removed obsolete diagnostic benchmarks, scratch scripts, and legacy HEALPix/WCS artifacts.
- CI rewritten: ruff-only lint, multi-OS/Python test matrix, CFITSIO vendoring via `extern/VERSIONS.txt`.
- Wheel builds: portable flags (no `-march=native`), `cp310`–`cp313` on macOS and Linux.

### Added

- GPU I/O transport benchmark rows (`bench_gpu_transports.py`) with **MPS** on Apple Silicon and **CUDA** on Linux.
- `pixi run bench-mps` for Apple Silicon accelerator benchmarks.
- Automated benchmark report workflow (`.github/workflows/bench-report.yml`).
- `scripts/render_bench_deficits.py` for documenting performance deficits without fixing them.

### Fixed

- Table mutations now invalidate FITS path caches via internal `io` helper (fixes `torchfits._invalidate_path_caches` AttributeError).

## Unreleased

## Earlier releases

Earlier 0.1.x through 0.3.x releases included broader experimental astronomy
domains. The current package contract is FITS I/O only; consult the current
README, API reference, roadmap, and parity matrix for supported behavior.
